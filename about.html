            I'm Jackie, a student at UC Berkeley, originally from Southern California.

            <p>I like to say that I inherited my love for photography from my father, who
            taught me everything I needed to know to spark my passion for it. I initially
            used photography as a way to document my travels around the world, but have since
            expanded more into portrait photography. I love focusing on people, their personalities,
            and their emotions, but I will always love a good adventure that focuses on the
            beauty of the world.

            <p>Feel free to contact me about anything! I love working with others and
            collaborating, and would be extremely happy to do so.
